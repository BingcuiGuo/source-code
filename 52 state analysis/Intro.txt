This is the air quality analysis for 52 states in 2020. 
Similar to what is done by Google mobility data, I use data before 2020.2.6 as base line and data after 2020.3.21 as change 
and calculate the percentage change of the air quality statewise and make plots in Tableau to see the change 
after the stay-at-home order for most of the states.
